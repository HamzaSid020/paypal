## Description
The provided code defines a JavaScript class, ShoesOrder, for handling the ordering process of shoes. It uses a series of prompts to gather information such as shoe type, size, color, and optional shoelaces. The user completes the order through PayPal, and upon successful payment, receives an order confirmation.
